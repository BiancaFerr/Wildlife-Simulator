# Wildlife-Simulator
An automatic data generation and labeling tool for animal detection from an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perspective. The proprietory assest are left out of the source code. A built version is also available.

**WARNING**
This repository still has some issues: The simulator program crashes periodically. This could be due to the GPU running out of memory or intersecting colliders causing an error.
